# Boot-pull-and-push
A offset in bootstrap will offset the left side of the column thus moving it over or "offsetting" something to the right. With the "offset" style you can only offset items to the right. For pushes and pulls you can pull something to the "left or right" or you can push something opposite of pull. Pushing or pulling items is primary used for column ordering.
